# Healthcare ETL System - Data Security Policy

**Document Version:** 1.0 
**Last Updated:** June 2025 
**Classification:** Internal Use

---

##  IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER

**This project includes a committed .env file with credentials.** This is a **deliberate design decision** for an educational project that:
- Contains only synthetic healthcare data
- Runs exclusively in local Docker containers
- Cannot access any external systems or real data
- Prioritizes easy reproduction for academic evaluation

**DO NOT** use this approach in any production system.

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the security policy for the Healthcare ETL System, covering both the current development implementation and the required production security measures. The current implementation **deliberately prioritizes ease of reproduction and educational clarity** by including configuration files that would typically be secured. This approach is safe because the system uses only synthetic data in isolated containers. This document serves as both a current state assessment and a roadmap for production deployment.

## 2. Current Development Configuration

### 2.1 Why Basic Security?

The current implementation maintains intentionally basic security for several reasons:

1. **Educational Accessibility**
   - Students and developers can understand the core ETL concepts without security complexity
   - Focus remains on data engineering patterns rather than security implementation
   - Easier debugging and troubleshooting during development

2. **Reproducibility**
   - Single `.env` file contains all configuration
   - No external key management systems required
   - Works on any machine with Docker installed
   - No cloud service dependencies

3. **Development Speed**
   - Rapid iteration without certificate management
   - No VPN or network security requirements
   - Instant setup for new team members

### 2.2 Current Security Implementation

```yaml
Current Security Measures:
  Database:
    - Basic password authentication
    - Single admin user for simplicity
    - No encryption at rest
    - Local Docker network isolation
    
  Application:
    - Environment variables for secrets
    - Basic input validation
    - SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
    - No HTTPS (HTTP only)
    
  Access Control:
    - Single database user
    - No role-based access control
    - No audit logging
    - Open ports on localhost only
```

### 2.3 Environment File Handling

**Current `.env` Structure:**
```bash
# Database Configuration
POSTGRES_USER=healthcare_admin
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secure_password_2024
POSTGRES_DB=healthcare_db
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://healthcare_admin:secure_password_2024@localhost:5432/healthcare_db

# Application Settings
APP_ENV=development
DEBUG=True
LOG_LEVEL=INFO

# ETL Configuration
BATCH_SIZE=1000
ERROR_THRESHOLD=0.05
```

**Deliberate Decision: .env File in Repository**

We have **intentionally included the .env file in the repository**, which goes against typical security practices. This decision was made for specific educational and practical reasons:

1. **Zero-Configuration Setup**
   - Clone repository → docker-compose up → System running
   - No manual environment configuration needed
   - Eliminates most common setup errors
   - Perfect for academic evaluation and peer review

2. **Why This Is Safe:**
   - **Local-only credentials**: Passwords only work for Docker containers
   - **No external services**: No API keys or cloud credentials
   - **Synthetic data only**: No real patient information at risk
   - **Isolated environment**: Containers run on local machine only
   - **Non-production system**: Explicitly marked as development

3. **Educational Transparency:**
   - Reviewers can see exact configuration
   - No hidden environmental dependencies
   - Reproducible results across all machines
   - Simplifies troubleshooting and grading

**Security Notice in .env:**
```bash
# DEVELOPMENT ONLY - NEVER USE IN PRODUCTION
# This file is intentionally committed for educational reproducibility
# These credentials only work with local Docker containers
# No external services or real data are accessible with these credentials
```

## 3. Security Risks in Current Configuration

### 3.1 Risk Assessment

| Risk                  | Current State                        | Impact | Likelihood | Actual Risk Level                  |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|--------|------------|------------------------------------|
| Plain text passwords  | Passwords in .env (committed)        | None   | Certain    | **No Risk** - Local containers only|
| No encryption         | Data unencrypted                     | None   | Certain    | **No Risk** - Synthetic data only  |
| Single user access    | No RBAC                              | None   | Certain    | **No Risk** - Development only     |
| No audit trail        | No logging                            | None   | Certain    | **No Risk** - No compliance req.   |
| HTTP only             | No TLS/SSL                           | None   | Certain    | **No Risk** - Localhost only       |
| No backup encryption  | Backups unencrypted                   | None   | N/A        | **No Risk** - No persistent backups|

### 3.2 Why Current Configuration Has No Real Security Risk:

1. **Committed .env File is Safe Because:**
   - **Container-scoped credentials**: Password "secure_password_2024" only works within Docker network
   - **No external exposure**: Cannot be used to access any external systems
   - **Localhost binding**: Database port 5432 only accessible from local machine
   - **Synthetic data**: Even if breached, no real patient data exists

2. **Intentional Design for Education:**
   ```yaml
   What the .env DOESN'T contain:
     - No AWS/Cloud credentials
     - No API keys for external services
     - No production database endpoints
     - No encryption keys for real data
     - No OAuth tokens or secrets
     - No payment processing keys
   ```

3. **Clear Development Markers:**
   - Password literally includes "secure_password_2024"
   - Database named "healthcare_db" (generic)
   - DEBUG=True clearly indicates development
   - APP_ENV=development explicitly set

### 3.3 Academic Project Benefits:

This approach provides significant advantages for an academic project:

1. **Instant Reproduction**
   - Professors/TAs can run project in < 2 minutes
   - No environmental setup failures
   - Consistent behavior across all machines

2. **Transparent Evaluation**
   - All configuration visible for assessment
   - No "works on my machine" issues
   - Easy to verify security understanding

3. **Focus on Learning**
   - Students study ETL patterns, not DevOps
   - Security concepts understood without implementation overhead
   - Clear progression path to production shown

### 3.4 README Security Notice

Our project README includes this clear notice:

```markdown
## Security Notice

This project includes a `.env` file with database credentials for 
**educational purposes only**. This is intentional to ensure easy 
reproduction and evaluation.

**Why this is safe:**
- Credentials only work with local Docker containers
- No external services or APIs are accessible
- Database contains only synthetic healthcare data
- Ports are bound to localhost only

**Never do this in production!**
See our security-policy.md for production security guidelines.
```

## 4. Production Security Requirements

When deploying the Healthcare ETL System in a production environment, the following security measures **must** be implemented to protect sensitive data, ensure compliance, and maintain system integrity.

### 4.1 Database Security
- **Strong Authentication & Access Control**
  - Use unique, strong passwords for all database users.
  - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access based on user roles (e.g., admin, analyst, ETL).
  - Disable or restrict superuser/admin access for applications.
- **Encryption**
  - Enable encryption at rest for all database files and backups.
  - Enforce SSL/TLS encryption for all connections to the database (encryption in transit).
- **Regular Updates**
  - Keep database software and dependencies up to date with security patches.

### 4.2 Application Security
- **Input Validation & Sanitization**
  - Validate and sanitize all user and data inputs to prevent SQL injection and other attacks.
- **Secrets Management**
  - Store secrets (passwords, API keys) in a secure secrets manager (not in code or version control).
- **HTTPS Everywhere**
  - Require HTTPS for all web interfaces and APIs.
- **Error Handling**
  - Do not expose sensitive error messages to end users.

### 4.3 Access Control & Audit Logging
- **Principle of Least Privilege**
  - Grant users and services only the minimum permissions necessary.
- **Audit Logging**
  - Enable detailed audit logging for all access to sensitive data and administrative actions.
  - Regularly review logs for suspicious activity.

### 4.4 Backup & Recovery
- **Encrypted Backups**
  - All backups must be encrypted at rest and in transit.
- **Regular Testing**
  - Regularly test backup and restore procedures to ensure data can be recovered.
- **Offsite Storage**
  - Store backups in a secure, geographically separate location.

### 4.5 Network Security
- **Firewalls**
  - Restrict database and application access to trusted IPs/networks only.
- **VPN & Segmentation**
  - Use VPNs and network segmentation to isolate sensitive systems.
- **No Public Exposure**
  - Never expose databases or sensitive services directly to the public internet.

### 4.6 Compliance & Data Protection
- **Regulatory Compliance**
  - Ensure compliance with relevant regulations (GDPR, ISO 27001, HIPAA, etc.).
- **Data Minimization & Retention**
  - Only collect and retain data necessary for business/clinical needs.
- **Data Subject Rights**
  - Implement processes for data access, correction, and deletion requests.

### 4.7 Monitoring & Incident Response
- **Continuous Monitoring**
  - Monitor systems for security events, anomalies, and performance issues.
- **Incident Response Plan**
  - Maintain and regularly test an incident response plan for data breaches or security incidents.

---

**Note:** These requirements are essential for any real deployment involving sensitive or real healthcare data. The current academic project intentionally omits these for educational clarity and reproducibility, but a production system **must** implement them to ensure security and compliance.

class Config:
    """Base configuration - current"""
    SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY') or 'dev-key'
    DATABASE_URL = os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL')

class ProductionConfig(Config):
    """Production configuration - required changes"""
    SECRET_KEY = get_secret('prod/app/secret_key')  # From vault
    DATABASE_URL = None  # Constructed from secrets
    
    @property
    def database_config(self):
        db_secret = get_secret('prod/db/credentials')
        return {
            'host': db_secret['host'],
            'port': db_secret['port'],
            'database': db_secret['database'],
            'user': db_secret['username'],
            'password': db_secret['password'],
            'sslmode': 'require',
            'sslcert': '/etc/ssl/certs/client-cert.pem',
            'sslkey': '/etc/ssl/private/client-key.pem'
        }
```

### 6.2 Infrastructure as Code

```yaml
# terraform/production/main.tf
resource "aws_db_instance" "healthcare_prod" {
  identifier     = "healthcare-prod-db"
  engine         = "postgres"
  engine_version = "15.3"
  
  # Security settings
  storage_encrypted               = true
  kms_key_id                     = aws_kms_key.rds.arn
  enabled_cloudwatch_logs_exports = ["postgresql"]
  deletion_protection            = true
  backup_retention_period        = 30
  backup_window                  = "03:00-04:00"
  
  # Network security
  db_subnet_group_name   = aws_db_subnet_group.private.name
  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.rds.id]
  publicly_accessible    = false
}
```

## 7. Conclusion

The current configuration with a **committed .env file** represents a deliberate educational choice that:

 **Achieves Educational Goals:**
- Any student/professor can run the project in minutes
- No environment-specific setup failures
- Complete transparency for code review
- Focus remains on ETL concepts, not infrastructure

**Maintains Safety:**
- Local-only credentials (literally "secure_password_2024")
- Synthetic data only (no real PHI/PII)
- Isolated Docker environment
- Clear development markers throughout

**But is Absolutely Unsuitable for Production**

The included .env file serves as a **teaching tool** - showing exactly what needs to be secured when moving to production. By including it, we can:
1. Demonstrate the complete system functionality
2. Show what secrets need protection
3. Provide a clear migration path to proper security

This document serves as both an explanation of our deliberate design decisions and a comprehensive guide for production security implementation. The stark contrast between our development simplicity and production requirements helps illustrate the importance of security evolution in the software lifecycle.
