# System Distribution Description

## Overview

The healthcare data engineering system is designed to be modular, scalable, and easy to deploy. The architecture leverages Docker containers for service isolation and reproducibility, and can be extended for distributed or production environments.

## 1. Current Distribution (Student Project)

- **Single Machine Deployment:**  
  All components (ETL scripts, PostgreSQL database, and optional pgAdmin) run on a single machine, orchestrated via Docker Compose.
- **Isolation:**  
  Each service runs in its own container, ensuring separation of concerns and easy troubleshooting.
- **Reproducibility:**  
  The environment can be recreated on any machine with Docker and Python, ensuring consistent results.

## 2. Scalability & Distributed Properties

- **Horizontal Scaling:**  
  - The PostgreSQL service can be scaled using Docker Swarm or Kubernetes for high availability.
  - ETL scripts can be run on multiple machines or scheduled via a workflow manager (e.g., Airflow) for large datasets.
- **Replication:**  
  - PostgreSQL supports master-slave replication for data redundancy and failover.
- **Sharding:**  
  - For very large datasets, the database can be sharded (partitioned) across multiple nodes, distributing the load.
- **Backup & Recovery:**  
  - Automated backups can be scheduled using cron jobs or cloud backup solutions.
- **Monitoring:**  
  - Logs and metrics can be collected using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or ELK stack.

## 3. Example Distributed Architecture (Production-Ready)

- **ETL Scripts:** Can be run from any machine with network access to the database.
- **PostgreSQL Primary/Replica:** Supports replication for high availability.
- **pgAdmin:** Optional, for database management.
- **Monitoring/Logging:** Centralized for all services.
- **Backups:** Automated and stored securely.

## 4. Summary

- **Current setup** is single-machine, containerized, and reproducible.
- **Production setup** can be distributed, with database replication, sharding, and centralized monitoring/logging.
- **All components** are modular and can be scaled or replaced independently.
